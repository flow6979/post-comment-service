## Component Breakdown

### cmd/

- **main.go**: The entry point of the application. It initializes the database connection, runs migrations, sets up the router, and starts the HTTP server.

### internal/

#### adapters/

- **repositories/**: Contains the implementation of data access layers.
  - **http/**: HTTP handlers for the API endpoints.
    - **handlers.go**: Defines the PostHandler struct and its methods.
    - **user_handler.go**: Defines the UserHandler struct and its methods.
  - **postgres/**: PostgreSQL implementations of the repositories.
    - **comment_repository.go**: Implements CommentRepository interface.
    - **post_repository.go**: Implements PostRepository interface.
    - **user_repository.go**: Implements UserRepository interface.
  - **router/**: Contains the router setup.
    - **router.go**: Defines the routes and their corresponding handlers.

#### application/

- **service.go**: Contains the business logic for posts, comments, and users. It implements the service interfaces defined in ports.

#### config/

- **config.go**: Handles loading and parsing of the configuration file.
- **config.yaml**: Contains configuration settings for the application.

#### domain/

- **models.go**: Defines the core domain models (Post, Comment, User).

#### ports/

- **ports.go**: Defines the interfaces for repositories and services, establishing the contract between different layers of the application.

### migrations/

Contains SQL migration files for database schema changes.

### pkg/

#### errors/

- **errors.go**: Custom error handling utilities.

#### logger/

- **logger.go**: Logging utilities for the application.

#### middleware/

- **auth.go**: JWT authentication middleware.

### tools/

- **create_migration.go**: A utility to create new migration files.

## Key Components and Their Interactions

1. **HTTP Handlers (internal/adapters/repositories/http/)**: These handle incoming HTTP requests, parse the request data, call the appropriate service methods, and format the response.

2. **Router (internal/adapters/repositories/router/)**: Defines the API endpoints and maps them to the appropriate handlers.

3. **Services (internal/application/service.go)**: Implement the business logic of the application. They coordinate between the HTTP handlers and the repositories, applying any necessary business rules.

4. **Repositories (internal/adapters/repositories/postgres/)**: Handle data persistence and retrieval from the PostgreSQL database.

5. **Domain Models (internal/domain/models.go)**: Define the core data structures used throughout the application.

6. **Ports (internal/ports/ports.go)**: Define interfaces that allow for loose coupling between different layers of the application, adhering to the ports and adapters (hexagonal) architecture.

7. **Config (internal/config/)**: Manages application configuration, allowing for easy modification of settings without changing code.

8. **Middleware (pkg/middleware/)**: Implements cross-cutting concerns like authentication.

9. **Error Handling (pkg/errors/)**: Provides custom error types and utilities for consistent error handling across the application.

10. **Logging (pkg/logger/)**: Offers a centralized logging mechanism for the entire application.

## Design Patterns and Principles

1. **Dependency Injection**: The application uses dependency injection to provide dependencies to structs, making the code more modular and testable.

2. **Repository Pattern**: Used to abstract the data layer, allowing for easy swapping of data sources if needed.

3. **Middleware Pattern**: Used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication.

4. **Hexagonal Architecture**: The application is structured to separate core business logic from external concerns, making it more maintainable and adaptable.

## Data Flow

1. An HTTP request comes in and is routed by the router to the appropriate handler.
2. The handler parses the request and calls the relevant service method.
3. The service applies any business logic and interacts with the appropriate repository.
4. The repository performs the necessary database operations.
5. The result flows back through the service to the handler, which formats the HTTP response.

## Authentication

The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. The auth middleware validates the JWT token for protected routes.

## Database

PostgreSQL is used as the database. Migrations are used to manage database schema changes, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Configuration

The application uses a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) for managing settings. This allows for easy configuration changes without modifying the code.

## Error Handling and Logging

Custom error types are used for consistent error handling. A centralized logging mechanism is implemented to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## Future Improvements

- Implement caching to improve performance.
- Add unit and integration tests for all components.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
- Add more comprehensive input validation and sanitization.
- Implement a more sophisticated authorization system (e.g., role-based access control).
